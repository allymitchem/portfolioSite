# Portfolio Site 	âœ¨

This site includes a home page, an about me page, and portfolio page. The portfolio page houses projects that may also be found within my repositories. Completed projects will be added to the portfolio. These will be listed starting from the most recent to the oldest.

Please let me know if you have any suggestions for improving the site! Creativity compells me to change things often!
