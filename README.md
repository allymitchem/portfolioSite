# Portfolio Site 	âœ¨

This site includes a home page, an about me page, and portfolio page. The portfolio showcases projects that may also be found in my GitHub [repositories](https://github.com/allymitchem?tab=repositories). New projects will be added to the portfolio, with the list sorted from the most recent to the oldest.

Please let me know if you have any suggestions for improving the site! Creativity compells me to change things often!
